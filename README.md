# Captain of Industry Titan Mod Tools

Welcome to the Titan mod tools resource for the [Captain of Industry](https://captain-of-industry.com) game.

## Questions, issues

Note that mod support is experimental and APIs might have breaking changes.
If you are having issues, always examine the logs in the `%APPDATA%/Captain of Industry/Logs` directory, they contain a lot of useful information.
If you'd like to discuss modding topics with the community and devs, visit our [Discord channel #modding-dev-general](https://discord.gg/JxmUbGsNRU) (you will need to assign yourself a `Mod creation` role in `#pick-your-roles-here` channel).
You can also file issues here on Github, but the response time from our team might be delayed.
